My name is Mark.  I grew up in the age of 8-bit computing, learning to program in BASIC, LISP, COMAL, and 6502 assembly language on my school's Commodore PET computers.  Since then, I have also dabbled with Smalltalk, C, C++, Perl, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, and Swift. Of all those, I would have to say that by far my favourite is Smalltalk.  I have enjoyed the recent resurgence in hobby computers (such as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino) which are recreating some of that early magic of discovery and are great for playing with home automation stuff.

Other than tinkering with computing projects, I also enjoy travelling, wandering around towns and the countryside, photographing places I go, and building LEGO.
