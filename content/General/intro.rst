Welcome to my blog!  This is a collection of some of the ramblings, thoughts, and ideas I have from time to time.  I don't claim to any kind of authority in anything I write about here and just post in the hope that something might be interesting or useful to others.

I have designed this site to make the most of the `spatial browsing`_ feature available on the `Apple Vision Pro`_ device.  You can select spatial browsing on any web page, however if Safari recognises that a page specifically supports spatial browsing, it will display a brief notification of "Spatial Browsing Available" with a blue background in the location bar.  When using this feature, sutable images will automatically get turned into spatial scenes, making them look like a window into the real world.  The page will also be accompanied by a small side panel allowing you to summarise the page content.  If you have access to a Vision Pro, try it out on any of the pages on this site!
